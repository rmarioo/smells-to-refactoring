# Code smells to refactorings

A list of code smells examples and related refactored versions.
  
The refactored version of each example is in the related branch with suffix "refactored"  
For example the refactored version of [conditionals] is in the [conditionals-refactored] branch 
 
In each *_refactored* branch looking at commits you can see how to obtain a refactored version through
small steps , and remaining always in green bar ( tests are passing at each  step )

There are many ways to land to a refactored version.  

You know other better ways ? Let me know!

Examples:
  - [Conditionals]    Conditionals checking "type" code smell
  - [Datafield]       A class (or group of classes) contains a data field. The field has its own behavior and associated data

Branches with refactored versions:
  - [conditionals-refactored]
  - [datafield-refactored]     To be completed
